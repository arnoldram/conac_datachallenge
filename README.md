# Data Challenge Solution Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive Jupyter notebook `Challenge_Medium_1.ipynb`, addressing a series of tasks to evaluate data handling, modeling, and visualization capabilities.

## Repository Structure

- `Challenge_Medium_1.ipynb`: The Jupyter notebook with the complete solution to the data challenge.
- `data/`: A subdirectory hosting all datasets used in the challenge.

## Challenge Overview

The challenge is divided into three main tasks:

1. **Task 1 - Basic Data Handling and Presentation**: Analysis of supermarket in-store purchases, identification of high turnover stores, frequent item combinations, and item purchase probabilities.

2. **Task 2 - Data Wrangling**: Matching company information across datasets with varying address conventions, and devising a canonicalization approach for address fields.

3. **Task 3 - Data Modelling**: Clustering of survey respondents into homogenous groups based on their grocery purchasing behavior, with a focus on Croatian consumers.

## Outputs

- **Code**: All code and pseudo-code, complete with notes and comments, are available in the provided Jupyter notebook.

- **Numerical Outputs**: Final models and statistical calculations are included in the notebook, with clear explanations of the results.

- **Visualizations**: Data visualizations, including interactive charts, are used to support the analysis and provide insights into the data.

## Instructions for Use

To view and interact with the analysis, clone the repository and launch `Challenge_Medium_1.ipynb` in a Jupyter environment. Ensure the `data/` directory is in the same location as the notebook for the code to execute correctly.
